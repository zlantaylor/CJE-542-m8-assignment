Module 8: Forecasting Trust in Police
Introduction
For this assignment, we will be using R and RStudio. R is a programming language designed for statistical computation, while RStudio provides a user-friendly environment for running R code. Although R has a learning curve since it is a programming language, you don't need to worry! These instructions will guide you step-by-step, explaining what each line of code does.
Overview
Between 2017 and 2023, the Chicago Police Department commissioned a study on Chicago residents’ sentiment towards the police. The study’s designers used Likert questions in their survey to have respondents rank how much they trust the police and how safe they felt using a scale from 1 (lowest value) to 10 (highest value).
The rankings were split by demographics like race, age group, and neighborhood. For this assignment, we’ll focus on trust levels by race.
